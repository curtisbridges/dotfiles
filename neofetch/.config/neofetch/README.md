# NeoFetch

NeoFetch doesn't really support themes. I've created the sub-directory here to contain "themes" but they are really just replacement `config.conf` files. To install them, replace your `config.conf` file with the contents of the chosen theme.

Most of these themes were sourced from https://github.com/Chick2D/neofetch-themes
